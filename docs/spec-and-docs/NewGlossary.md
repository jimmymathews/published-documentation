The most comprehensive study to date to investigate the connections of peripheral biology, brain, psychological, and bio-behavioral risk factors. Composed of a consortium of organizations and scientists throughout the U.S. and Canada, A2CPS is part of the multi-pronged [NIH HEAL](https://heal.nih.gov/) (Helping to End Addiction Long-Term) initiative, an aggressive effort to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis.

---

##### <u>API</u> 
`Application Programmer Interface`. Allows developers to manipulate (query, update) remote data sources through specific protocols or specific standards for communication (e.g., REST,SOAP). An important element of the ecosystem will be the standardization and publishing of an API that can be used by data consumers to retrieve the inventories, the data asset specification, and additional metadata associated with the assets. This will allow for consumers of these inventories to programmatically interrogate the federated system for information that may be relevant to a consuming service.

The goal of an ecosystem is to enable use cases between data silos, not within.

---

##### <u>CFDE Asset Manifest</u>
a collection of *Assets* described by the *CFDE Asset Specification*. The ecosystem will support the concept of a manifest that describes a collection of files. The manifests enable bundling lists of CFDE data assets into a machine-readable file using a common format. Manifests will also be used to publish the complete inventories of data from each DCC, and will enable uniform collection of asset metadata to support indexing of the assets in the CFDE portal.

---

##### <u>CFDE-asset-manifest</u>

Use case terms 
##### <u>Objective</u>
a description of a scientific process, told without reference to a specific technology solution. Focuses on resources required, method(s) followed, and outcome(s) targeted. Can be validated with scientific stakeholders.
##### <u>Persona</u>
a type of user who will appear in the epics and stories that follow.
##### <u>Requirement</u>
a well-scoped and defined piece of software or data engineering work that is needed to support a User Task. These should be small tasks that can be verified with engineering teams (e.g. `did we deliver it?` `yes` or `no`). A single requirement may be important for any number of different [User Task](#User-Task)s, and various collections of Requirements can be grouped to support different User Tasks.
##### <u>Summary</u>
a high-level, non-technical description of an entire `use case`. The user in each summary has a name, a scientific or administrative problem, and both proximate and ultimate goals. The focus is on the problem and what is generally needed to solve it.
##### <u>Use Case</u>
a `use case`, in software and systems engineering, is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system.
##### <u>User Task</u>
a `user story` is a story told from the user’s perspective that captures a concrete step in a user's interactions with tools (e.g., software solutions) in the service of achieving the scientific objective. A `user task` ++must be written in terms that are meaningful to the user, from their perspective++. This can be thought of as one in a series of medium scale tasks that must be completed to answer the question posed in the scientific objective. The list of `user tasks` in a [`use case`](#Use-Case) should cover everything the users needs to achieve their goals, even interactions that do not involve the software or data from the Common Fund.
